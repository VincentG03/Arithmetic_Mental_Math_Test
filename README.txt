Status: runnable, improvements continue to be added and are outlined below 


Program process:
- Ask for user input for the number of questions and difficulty 
- Depending on the input, prompt user for answers to math questions of type:
    - Addition and subtraction of integers 
    - Multiplication of integers 
    - Division with integer results 
- Print result along with useful statistics and feedback 


To be added:
[ ] Decimal stuff MULTIPLICATION (single whole number 1-9, one digit, one decimal place)* (single whole number 1- 9, one digit, one integer two decimal places)**
ADDITION/SUBTRACTION (two one integer, one digit deicmla places) (two, two digit integer and decimal places) (two, two integer, three deicmal palces)
DIVISON (always give answer of multiple of 0.5, one digit divisor) (always give answer  of multiple of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) (always give answer of multple 0.1, two digit and one digit)

[ ] Fraction stuff (fractional adding)
[ ] Interface (tkinter)
[ ] Timer for each type of question (i.e you may) (which section they look the longest on)
[ ] Have an option of what question types they want 


Known issues:
- When accepting input answers, does not catch error of when its not a number - assuming we would need try except statements but the body would be too long (read elsewhere that you should keep try statemnts as small as possible)
